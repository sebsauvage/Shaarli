### ► Play Videos plugin for Shaarli

Adds a `► Play Videos` button to [Shaarli](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli)'s toolbar. Click this button to play all videos on the page in an overlay HTML5 player. Nice for continuous stream of music, documentaries, talks...

<!-- TODO screenshot -->

This uses code from https://zaius.github.io/youtube_playlist/ and is currently only compatible with Youtube videos.

#### Installation and setup

This is a default Shaarli plugin, you just have to enable it. See https://shaarli.readthedocs.io/en/master/Shaarli-configuration/


#### Troubleshooting

If your server has [Content Security Policy](http://content-security-policy.com/) headers enabled, this may prevent the script from loading fully. You should relax the CSP in your server settings. Example CSP rule for apache2:

In `/etc/apache2/conf-available/shaarli-csp.conf`:

```apache
<Directory /path/to/shaarli>
    Header set Content-Security-Policy "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://www.youtube.com https://s.ytimg.com 'unsafe-eval'"
</Directory>
```

Then run `a2enconf shaarli-csp; service apache2 reload`
