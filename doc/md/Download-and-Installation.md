To install Shaarli, simply place the files in a directory under your webserver's
Document Root (or directly at the document root).

Also, please make sure your server is properly [configured](Server-configuration.md).

Multiple releases branches are available:

- latest (last release)
- stable (previous major release)
- master (development)

Using one of the following methods:

- by downloading full release archives including all dependencies
- by downloading Github archives
- by cloning the Git repository
- using Docker: [see the documentation](docker/shaarli-images.md)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Latest release (recommended)

### Download as an archive

In most cases, you should download the latest Shaarli release from the [releases](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli/releases) page. Download our **shaarli-full** archive to include dependencies.

The current latest released version is `v0.10.4`

```bash
$ wget https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli/releases/download/v0.10.4/shaarli-v0.10.4-full.zip
$ unzip shaarli-v0.10.4-full.zip
$ mv Shaarli /path/to/shaarli/
```

### Using git

Cloning using `git` or downloading Github branches as zip files requires additional steps:

 * Install [Composer](Unit-tests.md#install_composer) to manage third-party [PHP dependencies](3rd-party-libraries.md#composer).
 * Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) to build the frontend dependencies.
 * Install [python3-virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) to build the local HTML documentation.

```
$ mkdir -p /path/to/shaarli && cd /path/to/shaarli/
$ git clone -b latest https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli.git .
$ composer install --no-dev --prefer-dist
$ make build_frontend
$ make translate
$ make htmldoc
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stable version

### Download as an archive

```bash
$ wget https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli/archive/stable.tar.gz

# install/update third-party dependencies

$ composer install --no-dev --prefer-dist
```


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Development version (mainline)

_Use at your own risk!_

Install [Composer](Unit-tests.md#install_composer) to manage Shaarli PHP dependencies,
