This note is private, so you are the only one able to see it while logged in.

You can use this to keep notes, post articles, code snippets, and much more.

The Markdown formatting setting allows you to format your notes and bookmark description:

### Title headings

#### Multiple headings levels
  * bullet lists
  * _italic_ text
  * **bold** text
  * ~~strike through~~ text
  * `code` blocks
  * images
  * [links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

Markdown also supports tables:

| Name    | Type      | Color  | Qty   |
| ------- | --------- | ------ | ----- |
| Orange  | Fruit     | Orange | 126   |
| Apple   | Fruit     | Any    | 62    |
| Lemon   | Fruit     | Yellow | 30    |
| Carrot  | Vegetable | Red    | 14    |

Shaarli allows you to bookmark your favorite pages, and share them with others or store them privately.
You can add a description to your bookmarks, such as this one, and tag them.

Create a new shaare by clicking the `+Shaare` button, or using any of the recommended tools (browser extension, mobile app, bookmarklet, REST API, etc.).

You can easily retrieve your links, even with thousands of them, using the internal search engine, or search through tags (e.g. this Shaare is tagged with `shaarli` and `help`).
Hashtags such as #shaarli #help are also supported.
You can also filter the available [RSS feed](/feed/atom) and picture wall by tag or plaintext search.

We hope that you will enjoy using Shaarli, maintained with ❤️ by the community!
Feel free to open [an issue](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli/issues) if you have a suggestion or encounter an issue.
